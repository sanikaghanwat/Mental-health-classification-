Mental health history is more prevalent among females. Many individuals are not interested in their jobs, which often leads to disturbances in mental health.

Feature Engineering:

The dataset was examined for null values and categorical values were labeled.

Data Preprocessing:

The data was split into training and testing datasets.

Model Building and Evaluation:

Various classification models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained and tested. The Logistic Regression Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 53.62%.
